Here are three valerian-root capsules that match the dose range (≈ 300-600 mg at bedtime), avoid melatonin or magnesium, have solid Canadian availability, and earn consistently good reviews on Amazon.ca.  Start with **one capsule 30–60 min before bed**, use only on nights when anxiety keeps you awake, and stop if vivid dreams or morning grogginess appear.

## 1. Natural Factors Valerian Root — Standardized Extract 300 mg

*90 capsules – Canadian GMP brand, NPN 80048817*

* **Actives:** 300 mg 4 : 1 root extract (equiv. 1 200 mg dried) **standardized to 0.8 % valerenic acids** (the main sedative compounds). ([Natural Vitamin Direct natvd.com][1], [Natural Factors Canada][2])
* **Why it tops the list:** delivers a *measured valerenic-acid dose* that clinical trials associate with better sleep; made and licensed in Canada; allergen-free formula.
* **How to use:** 1 capsule (= 300 mg extract) 30–60 min before bed. Can increase to 2 if needed (maximum 600 mg extract).

## 2. Nature’s Way Valerian Root 530 mg

*100 vegetarian caps – Non-GMO Project Verified, NPN 80010958*

* **Actives:** 530 mg pure root powder per capsule (no fillers). ([Nature's Way Canada][3], [Amazon Canada][4])
* **Why it’s a strong pick:** clean one-ingredient formula, trustworthy brand, vegetarian capsule. One cap gives a *gentle* 530 mg whole herb; two caps (1 060 mg) approach traditional herbal doses for stubborn insomnia.
* **How to use:** begin with 1 capsule; if not sleepy after 45 min, take a *second* the next night.

## 3. NOW Foods Valerian Root 500 mg

*100 veg caps – Non-GMO, vegan, NPN 80002836*

* **Actives:** 500 mg root powder per capsule. ([Amazon Canada][5], [NOW Foods][6])
* **Why it makes the cut:** very high review volume (>4 ★), budget friendly, easy to halve (open the veg-cap) for an initial 250 mg micro-dose if your sensitivity flares.
* **How to use:** 1 capsule at bedtime; open and pour out half the powder for a 250 mg trial dose if desired.

### Practical tips for sensitive sleepers

* **Intermittent use:** take valerian only on troublesome nights (e.g., no more than 2-3 times a week) to avoid tolerance.
* **Watch for odour:** valerian naturally smells “earthy-wet-sock.”  Storing capsules in the fridge or freezer limits the odor when you open the bottle.  Breaking a capsule (Nature’s Way / NOW) does release more smell; Natural Factors’ smaller extract capsules or coated Jamieson softgels (see below) help if aroma is bothersome.
* **Side-effect check:** drowsiness or vivid dreams next morning signal the dose is too high; cut back or skip the next dose.  Avoid alcohol, antihistamines, or prescription sedatives the same night (potentiation).
* **Rotate herbs:** after 2–3 weeks of use, pause valerian and rely on L-theanine, chamomile, or simple breath work for a week to keep it effective.

*Runner-up (for smell-averse users)* – **Jamieson Valerian Root 400 mg softgels**: TRU-ID® authenticated Canadian brand; reviewers praise its small, easy-to-swallow softgel but note the classic valerian odour when the bottle opens. Requires 1–3 softgels (400 – 1 200 mg root equiv.) and costs ≈ CA \$10 for 60 softgels. ([Amazon Canada][7])
