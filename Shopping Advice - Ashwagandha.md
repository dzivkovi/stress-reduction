# Ashwagandha for Sensitive Individuals

## Amazon.com: Ashwagandha for Sensitive Individuals

Here’s a side-by-side look at the two products, so you can choose the best fit for your wife’s sensitivity and your budget.

### 1. Ingredient Profile & Standardization

* **Himalaya Organic Ashwagandha (670 mg caplet)** combines:

  * 380 mg root powder (0.2% withanolides → 0.76 mg)
  * 280 mg root extract (0.5% withanolides → 1.4 mg)
  * 10 mg supercritical CO₂ extract (8% withanolides → 0.8 mg)
  * **Total withanolides ≈ 2.96 mg per caplet**.
  * Labelled “standardized to 5% withanolides” and USDA Organic, Non-GMO, Vegan, Gluten-Free.
* **Organic India Ashwagandha** (90 capsules) lists **400 mg pure root powder per capsule**, with no additional extracts or stated standardization of withanolides.
* **Takeaway:** Himalaya delivers a precise blend of powder + extracts for a known withanolide dose; Organic India is pure root powder (milder, unstandardized).

### 2. Dosage & Potency

* Clinical trials typically use **250–600 mg of standardized extract** daily to lower cortisol and anxiety. Himalaya delivers \~290 mg extract plus a small supercritical extract—aligning with study doses.
* Organic India’s 400 mg of root powder likely yields **much lower** active content (without extract), so you’d need more capsules to hit clinical levels.
* **For high sensitivity:**

  * With Himalaya, you can start at **½–1 caplet** (\~300 mg total) and adjust.
  * With Organic India, you’d need **2–3 capsules** to approach an extract-equivalent dose, which may be harder to titrate if she’s sensitive.

### 3. Price & Value

| Product                               | Count |    Unit Price | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ----: | ------------: | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Himalaya Organic Ashwagandha (670 mg) |    60 | CA \$0.35/cap | 2-month supply, blends powder + extract, 5% withanolides |
| Organic India Ashwagandha (400 mg)    |    90 | CA \$0.23/cap | 3-month supply, pure root powder, no standardization     |

* **Himalaya** costs more per caplet but delivers a **known withanolide dose**.
* **Organic India** is cheaper per capsule but requires higher counts to reach clinical potency.

### 4. Quality & Safety Considerations

* Both brands are **USDA Organic, Non-GMO, Vegan, Gluten-Free**, and widely available in Canada.
* **Third-party testing** is crucial for heavy metals and purity—dietitians recommend choosing supplements that disclose such testing([Health](https://www.health.com/best-ashwagandha-supplements-8648166?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* Ayurveda experts and wellness sites list Himalaya as the **best budget** extract option and Organic India as the **best organic** choice, reflecting their respective strengths([Byrdie](https://www.byrdie.com/best-ashwagandha-supplements-4690414?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* Supplements are unregulated by Health Canada; look for **GMP or third-party seals** on the label to ensure quality([Verywell Health](https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-anxiety-supplements-7373504?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 5. Recommendation

* **If you want guaranteed, study-aligned potency** and fine-tunable dosing: choose **Himalaya Organic Ashwagandha**. Its blend of powder + extract provides a known withanolide content that matches clinical research, and you can start with half a caplet if she’s sensitive.
* **If you prefer a gentler, lower-potency start** and the lowest cost per pill: choose **Organic India Ashwagandha**, but be prepared to take more capsules to reach effective doses—and know the active content is unstandardized.

Either way, begin at **half the suggested dose**, monitor her response, and adjust upward slowly. Always check for third-party quality seals and consult a healthcare provider if new symptoms arise.

Here’s a ranked list of your Canadian-available options, ordered from most to least suited for starting low in a highly sensitive individual:

### Key takeaway

- **Now Foods Ashwagandha 400 mg** offers a gentle, standardized 4.5 % withanolide extract at a dose you can easily halve (200 mg ≈ 9 mg withanolides), aligning with study-backed starting levels (120–600 mg/day) ([EatingWell][1], [NationalNutrition.ca][2]).
- **Himalaya Organic Ashwagandha (670 mg)** combines powder + extracts delivering only \~3 mg total withanolides per caplet—ideal for ultra-low starts (½ caplet ≈1.5 mg) ([Amazon][3], [Optimum Health & Kolya][4]).
- **Renew Actives KSM-66 (500 mg)** is a full-spectrum root extract (standardized to ≥5 % withanolides) with black pepper for absorption; you can begin at ½ capsule ≈12.5 mg withanolides ([Amazon][5], [Amazon][6]).
- **EBYSU Ashwagandha (650 mg)** is a Canadian-made root powder + black pepper formula, labeled 5 % withanolides (≈32.5 mg/capsule), so start at ½ capsule ≈16 mg if you choose this ([Amazon][7]).
- **AOR Gandha-600 (600 mg)** is a potent 10:1 extract standardized for withanolides and sitoindosides (600 mg extract ≈6 g root equivalent), best reserved for later titration ([aor.ca][8], [Amazon][9]).

### Recommendation

* **First choice:** *Now Foods* for its defined 4.5 % withanolide content and straightforward half-capsule dosing.
* **Runner-up:** *Himalaya* for the lowest total withanolides—ideal if extreme gentleness is needed.
* **Titration plan:** Start at **½ capsule** of your chosen product, monitor response for 5–7 days, then adjust gradually.
